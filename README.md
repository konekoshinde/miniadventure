Welcome, brave adventurer, to the World of Dungeon! Your quest is to retrieve the sacred weapon hidden in the depths of the dungeon. However, be warned, for the moment you lay hands on the sacred weapon, the dungeon stirs, and monstrous creatures awaken to challenge your escape.

As you navigate the dark corridors, monsters lurk around every corner. You possess knowledge of the escape route, but the relentless pursuit of these creatures complicates your journey. You must decide whether to outpace the monsters or engage them in battle.

Beware! If a monster catches up with you, it will relentlessly pursue you until the bitter end. Encounter two monsters simultaneously, and your fate is sealed! You can slay a single monster when your health is at its peak, but be cautious, for vanquishing a foe will leave you with bare hp!! But in the perilous realm, cross paths with a monstrous foe while your health wanes, your demise shall be swift and certain.

The gods of the dungeon world are willing to aid, but their assistance is limited without the sacred device. Your only respite is the unexplored path, where you can restore your health and gradually increase your vitality. Once your health reaches 100, the dungeon's power will be restored, and the path will be ready to heal you in times of dire need.

Navigate wisely, valiant adventurer, and may you emerge triumphant from the treacherous depths of the dungeon!
